Gamemaker 1.4 startup project for Game Jams

Contains an empty project with some helpful predefined functions and settings.
This is by design not a template for a given game genre, so things like character handling (e.g. for platformers) are not included here.

Planned features:
- Keyboard handling
- Optional controller support
- Generic title screen
- Loading a custom font
- Set up to compile for Windows and HTML

Maybe planned features:
- Set up to compile for Android
- Set up to compile for Linux
- Set up to compile for iOS
